Ursina is an open source python game engine https://www.ursinaengine.org/

All of the parts are still incomplete...but perhaps the closest thing to completion currently is the
dice.py file. It simply creates a cube (which will hopefully be a die one day) and tosses it spinning
in the air. It bounces on a floor and has the speed increase of 9.81 units per unit time. Closing the
application in a convienient way is still a problem.

For dice.py the useful keys when it's running are:
	"space":	which tosses the die 
			spinning in the air.

	"p":		which toggles a pause
			feature for the die.

Another interesting file is urstest.py, where I was practicing what I wanted. There are more keys to
play with the die. Among which you can move the die with "wasd", and there are 6 rotation keys "tgbyhn"
in addition to the "space" and "p" keys in the others. There is also an "esc" key to destroy the app.
